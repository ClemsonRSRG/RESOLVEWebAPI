RESOLVEWebAPI
==============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ClemsonRSRG/RESOLVEWebAPI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ClemsonRSRG/RESOLVEWebAPI)
<img align="right" src="public/images/resolve_logo.png"/>

This is the back-end API that services request to compile, translate and verification using the RESOLVE compiler. 
The project requires `sbt 1.x`, `Scala 2.12.x`, `Java 8+` and `Play Framework 2.6.x` to run. 
Instructions to install these requirements can be found on their respective websites.

## Setting up

As a prerequisite, you will need to download and install `sbt 1.x` and `Java JDK 8+`. The current project is already 
configured to install `Scala 2.12.x`, `Play Framework` and all necessary plugins. Instructions on how to 
setup your favorite development IDE can be found [here](http://www.playframework.com/).

(* Add more instructions when they are needed *)

## What is RESOLVE?

RESOLVE (REusable SOftware Language with VErification) is a programming and
specification language designed for verifying correctness of object oriented
programs.

The RESOLVE language is designed from the ground up to facilitate *mathematical
reasoning*. As such, the language provides syntactic slots for assertions such
as pre-post conditions that are capable of abstractly describing a program's
intended behavior. In writing these assertions, users are free to draw from from
a variety of pre-existing and user-defined mathematical theories containing
fundamental axioms, definitions, and results necessary/useful in establishing
program correctness.

All phases of the verification process spanning verification condition (VC)
generation to proving are performed in-house, while RESOLVE programs are
translated to Java and run on the JVM.

## Authors and major contributors
The creation and continual evolution of the RESOLVE language is owed to an
ongoing joint effort between Clemson University, The Ohio State University, and
countless educators and researchers from a variety of [other](https://www.cs.clemson.edu/resolve/about.html) 
institutions.
